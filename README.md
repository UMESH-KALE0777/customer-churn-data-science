📊 Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End Data Science Project
🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based businesses. This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict customer churn using structured customer data.

The goal is to:

Identify customers likely to leave

Understand key churn drivers

Help businesses take proactive retention actions

This is a complete end-to-end Data Science pipeline, including:

Data Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Building

Model Evaluation

Deployment-ready structure

🎯 Business Problem

Customer acquisition is expensive. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

If we can predict:

"Which customers are likely to churn?"

We can:

Offer targeted discounts

Improve customer experience

Reduce revenue loss

Increase customer lifetime value
